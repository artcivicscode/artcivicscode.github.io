Code for Seattle and Independent Sector are partnering to host a hackathon to educate nonprofit leaders on what can happen when technology and volunteerism meet. Specifically, the hackathon will focus on creating teams of artists & technologists working on civics-focused projects.

Independent Sector is a national nonprofit organization with a mission to advance the common good by leading, strengthening, and mobilizing the nonprofit community.  In Seattle this fall, they are hosting their annual Public Policy Action Institute (PPAI), where over 120 nonprofit leaders from across the country will gather to share best practices on how to make a greater impact in their communities.

Art + Civics Code will not only generate creative new ideas for the city of Seattle, but also inspire civic leaders from across the country to re-think how nonprofits, government, and volunteers can leverage technology to tackle community needs.

The event is on November 15, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. at the Seattle Sheraton.
