Attend the Nov. 15 Art + Civics + Code Hackathon to work on projects that make public art more accessible, that create new ways for residents to explore Seattle, & that beautifully present open data.

It takes more than just technological solutions to build community and address civic issues. This event is an experiment in supporting collaborative, cross-discipline projects that not only generate creative new ideas for the city of Seattle, but also inspire civic leaders from across the country to re-think how nonprofits, government, and volunteers can leverage technology to tackle community needs.

## Projects

###Existing projects that you can join:

- Seattle Icons
  - Help create a set of icons all about Seattle! Design icons for neighborhoods, landmarks, and other important aspects of Seattle. You can sketch ideas, turn sketches into SVG images, or both!
- Artwalk app
  - Help create an open-source tool for exploring the locations of an artwalk.
  

## Pitch a project

Have a project that combines art, civic engagement, and technology? Cool! You should bring it to Art + Civics + Code and lead a team to work on the project. [Submit some basic information about the project](http://goo.gl/forms/BcxB8ufho7), and if it fits the scope of the event, we'll add it to the list!

**Ideal projects include:** 

- arts organizations or individual artists that need technological help
- projects that help make public art easier to discover & share
- beautiful/unexpected/inventive presentation of open data 

Have an idea that doesn't completely fit those guidelines but still has something to do with art, civic engagement, & technology? Awesome. [Tell us about it](http://goo.gl/forms/BcxB8ufho7).

Code for Seattle and Independent Sector are partnering to host a hackathon as part of this year's Public Policy Action Institute to educate nonprofit leaders on what can happen when technology and volunteerism meet. This hackathon will focus on creating teams of artists & technologists working on civics-focused projects.

Independent Sector is a national nonprofit organization with a mission to advance the common good by leading, strengthening, and mobilizing the nonprofit community.  In Seattle this fall, they are hosting their annual Public Policy Action Institute (PPAI), where over 120 nonprofit leaders from across the country will gather to share best practices on how to make a greater impact in their communities.
