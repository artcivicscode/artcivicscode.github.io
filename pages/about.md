What happens when artists & technologists team up to work on civic engagement projects? How can art & technology improve the visibility & accessibility of data about the place we live?

Art + Civics + Code will explore projects that make public art more accessible, that create new ways for residents to explore the places they live, & that beautifully present open data.
